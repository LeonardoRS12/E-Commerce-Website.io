This is the repository for the project of an E-Commerce Website that i made

In this website you can navigate throught the page to see different products.
I made this website using HTML,CSS and JavaScript,i also integrate a fake E-Commerce API for demostration of the functionality of this website.
This website is not finished yet im still working on it so dont worry if you have problems on it.
